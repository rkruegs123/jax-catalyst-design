# jax-catalyst-design

Code for designing **spider catalysts**

## Jan. 17, 2023

For next time:
- test on GPU
  - note that we'll need a local version of the jax-md changes that we did. Will likely want to make a conda environment that has its wn install of jax-md
  - changes are `union_to_points` and in `RigidPointUnion.__getitem__`
- setup optimization
  - note that an initial thing we can do to avoid dummy local minima (i.e. having a huge spider catalyst to splay apart the shell vertices via excluded volume) is to make the initialized height of the catalyst a function of its two radii (well, really the max of something like (head_radius - height, leg_radius), as well as a function of base radius
  - note: could setup two optimizations -- one that only optimizes over energy, another that optimizes over both shape and energy

From today
- Tried to setup a training loop but didn't actually run it
  - need to add a batch size (at the least)
- were getting nans for some spider shape stuff. added some noise to msases and got non-nan grads. but then re-ran on cluster and got 0 gradients for some more things. Maybe we didn't originally save the flie or osmetihng? Maybe we should run again locally? Maybe we didn't run for long enough? Some stocahsticity there? Have to experiment
  - maybe should install the github rpeo on a colab and visualize with the new masses. unequal masses may be messing pu the initialization
- once we resolve the above, just setup a training loop and hit go
