# jax-catalyst-design

Code for designing **spider catalysts**

## Jan. 17, 2023

For next time:
- test on GPU
  - note that we'll need a local version of the jax-md changes that we did. Will likely want to make a conda environment that has its wn install of jax-md
  - changes are `union_to_points` and in `RigidPointUnion.__getitem__`
- setup optimization
  - note that an initial thing we can do to avoid dummy local minima (i.e. having a huge spider catalyst to splay apart the shell vertices via excluded volume) is to make the initialized height of the catalyst a function of its two radii (well, really the max of something like (head_radius - height, leg_radius), as well as a function of base radius
  - note: could setup two optimizations -- one that only optimizes over energy, another that optimizes over both shape and energy
