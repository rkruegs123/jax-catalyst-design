Maybe no xlabel in the first plot in the column

Maybe rerun the abductive limit with higher energy so that the stability loss temr blows up

Maybe take the log of the remaining energyterm, as well as maybe the stability term, in the diffusive limit. Could also either cut the x or y axis.

See screenshot for revised Figure 3
