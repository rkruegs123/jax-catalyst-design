0. Check simulation with only 11 of the 12 vertices
1. fix printing
2. Take notes in README, including relevant directories
3. run more optimizations
  - different head eps, different r onset/cutoff
4. Run forward simulations
  - 5k steps from the low remainng energy results, and mayb eofrward simulations to check what head eps we can usee (and maybe also ronset and rcutoff??)
5. Cool down task: read-in parameters
